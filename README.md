# Docker Codeserver Container

This container runs a code-server instance, which is an Open Source version of
Visual Studio Code that runs on a remote server and accessible through the
browser. It's part of a way to duplicate the Github Codespaces experience for
students that can't get GitHub accounts or are having their accounts suspended.
